# Optimizer improvement log

Append-only. Each entry: the idea, whether it worked, and its impact on the snapshot
(`Leanr/OpenVM/Snapshot.lean`, single OpenVM ADD-immediate). **Effectiveness** = distinct
variables in the input / distinct variables in the optimizer output (`≥ 1`; higher is better).
The input has **36** distinct variables, so effectiveness `1` = 36 output variables.

Invariants held for every commit: `lake build` succeeds, `optimizer_maintainsCorrectness` is
proven (no `sorry`/`admit`/`axiom`/`native_decide`), and the frozen spec/bus-semantics/test input
are untouched (only the recorded snapshot *string* is regenerated as the output changes).

---

## Architecture

The optimizer is a pipeline of **verified passes** (`Leanr/OptimizerPasses/Basic.lean`): each pass
is a function `cs → bs → { out // PassCorrect cs out bs }`, i.e. it carries its own proof that the
output is equivalent to the input and preserves invariants. Passes compose with `.andThen`
(correctness by transitivity), so the whole `optimizer` is correct by construction and the public
`optimizer_maintainsCorrectness` is just a projection.

Reusable, proven equivalence machinery (the hard proofs live here once; passes are thin):

- **`OptimizerPasses/Subst.lean`** — substitution `x := t`. If satisfying assignments force
  `x = t`, substituting everywhere is equivalence-preserving (`ConstraintSystem.subst_correct`).
  This is the workhorse for *variable elimination* (the only thing that moves the effectiveness
  metric, which counts distinct variables). Purely equational — no field assumptions.
- **`OptimizerPasses/Rewrite.lean`** — (a) `mapExpr`: any *eval-preserving* expression rewrite
  (constant folding, algebraic simplification) is automatically correct (`mapExpr_correct`);
  (b) `filterConstraints`: dropping *identically-zero* algebraic constraints is correct
  (`filterConstraints_correct`).

A pass = a decidable *detection* (find an `(x, t)` / a rewrite / a removable constraint) + supply
the entailment hypothesis to the relevant core lemma. In the `none`/not-applicable case a pass
falls back to the identity.

`babyBear = 2013265921` is prime; `Nat.Prime babyBear` is provable by `norm_num` (no axiom / no
`native_decide`), so field structure is available to passes that need it (e.g. dividing by a
nonzero constant coefficient). Introduced only when a pass requires it.

## Entries

### 0. Setup (infrastructure only; effectiveness unchanged at 1)
Added the reusable proof cores above (`Subst.lean`, `Rewrite.lean`) and this log. Pipeline is
still the identity, so the snapshot and effectiveness (`1`) are unchanged; this commit only lays
the foundation. The substitution correctness proof (the linchpin) is complete and general.
**Impact: none yet (36 → 36 variables).** Worked: yes (builds, cores proven).

### 1. Constant folding / algebraic normalization (`ConstantFold.lean`) — enabler
Idea: a bottom-up eval-preserving rewrite (`Expression.fold`) that folds `const∘const`, drops
`+0`, and handles `*0`/`*1`, applied to every expression via the proven `mapExpr_correct`. Ranked
#1 by the idea workflow purely as an *enabler*: it removes no variable directly, but canonicalizes
the DSL sugar (`x - c` = `x + (-1)*c`, `2013265920 * 1`, `0 + …`) into the normal forms the later
detection passes rely on, and collapses `c * 0` to a literal `0` once substitution plants a zero.
Worked: yes — the snapshot is now visibly folded (e.g. `0 + opcode_add_flag_0 + …` → `opcode_add_flag_0 + …`,
`2013265920 * 1` → `2013265920`). Correctness is free from `mapExpr_correct` (only `fold_eval`, one
induction, no field). **Impact: effectiveness still 1 (36 → 36); shape only, as expected for an enabler.**

### 2. Constant substitution (`ConstantSubst.lean`) — first real reduction
Idea: after folding, a variable pinned to a constant shows up as `x` (⇒ `x=0`) or `x + const d`
(⇒ `x=-d`). `solveConst` detects these; `substFromConstraint` (a generic combinator: find the first
solvable constraint, substitute via the proven `subst_correct`, else identity) turns it into a pass.
The entailment `env x = c` comes from the constraint being `0` under `satisfies`, proved by
`linear_combination`. Pipeline now folds, then iterates "substitute one constant, re-fold" to a
fixpoint (`VerifiedPass.iterate`). No field/primality — works over any commutative ring.
Worked: yes. Eliminates exactly the 5 constant-pinned variables `from_state__pc_0=0`, `rd_ptr_0=8`,
`rs1_ptr_0=8`, `rs2_0=1`, `rs2_as_0=0` (the last is the cascade trigger). **Impact: 36 → 31,
effectiveness 36/31 ≈ 1.16.** `reads_aux__1__…` now survive only inside interactions whose
multiplicity became `0` (removed once zero-mult bus dropping lands).

### 3. Trivial-constraint removal (`TrivialConstraint.lean`) — cascade enabler
Idea: drop algebraic constraints whose fold is the literal `0` (via `filterConstraints_correct`);
`Expression.isConstZero` is the decidable check, and the dropped-are-zero obligation is discharged
by `fold_eval` + `isConstZero_sound`. Added into the fixpoint loop (fix → fold → drop-trivial).
Worked: yes — output algebraic constraints dropped from 32 to 21 (removed `1-1`, `0-0`, the five
now-satisfied `x=const` defining constraints, and the `rs2_as_0 * (…)` constraints that folded to
`0`). Field-free. **Impact: effectiveness unchanged at 36/31 (no variable is removed by this pass
alone — the freed aux variables still live in zero-multiplicity interactions), but it is the
prerequisite that isolates them for the next pass.**

### 4. Zero-multiplicity bus removal (`ZeroMultBus.lean`) — realizes the cascade
Idea: drop bus interactions whose multiplicity folds to the literal `0`, via a new proven core
`filterBus_correct`. The correctness has two parts: the dropped interaction's `violatesConstraint`
obligation is vacuous (multiplicity `≠ 0` is false), and a `0`-multiplicity stateful entry adds `0`
to every message's net multiplicity so the bus states stay `≈`-equal (`multiplicitySum_filterBus`,
by induction on the interaction list). This is the *only* spec-safe bus removal — cancelling
opposite-sign pairs is rejected as unsound for arbitrary bus semantics (it would drop real
`violatesConstraint` obligations). Field-free. Added last in the fixpoint cycle.
Worked: yes. Once `rs2_as_0 := 0` zeroes the second read's multiplicities, those interactions are
dropped, removing the last occurrences of `reads_aux__1__base__prev_timestamp_0` and the two
`reads_aux__1__…lower_decomp…` limbs. **Impact: 31 → 28, effectiveness 36/28 = 9/7 ≈ 1.29.** This
completes the general, field-free portion (8 variables eliminated from 36).

### 5. Affine substitution / linear elimination (`Affine.lean`) — generalizes constant substitution
Idea: the general form of variable elimination. Normalize a constraint to a linear form
`a₀ + Σ aᵢ·vᵢ` (`linearize`, with `linearize_eval` proving it eval-preserving; returns `none` on a
genuine variable×variable product). If some variable `x` has a unit coefficient (`±1`), solve
`x = ∓(a₀ + rest)` and substitute via the proven `subst_correct`. The entailment `env x = t`
comes from `LinExpr.eval_split` (coefficient/remainder decomposition) + the constraint being `0`.
Fed to the same `substFromConstraint` combinator; replaces `constantFixPass` in the pipeline (a
constant is the 0-term affine case). Purely equational — unit coefficients are units in **any**
commutative ring, so still no field/primality needed (a generality strength: works over any modulus).
Worked: yes. Beyond the 5 constants it eliminates `c__2_0` (`c2 = c3`), `c__0_0`
(`c0 = 1 - 256·c1 - 65536·c2`), `opcode_add_flag_0` (`Σ flags = 1`) and `opcode_sub_flag_0`
(weighted-flag sum `= 0`). Since substitution is *degree-preserving* (a linear variable becomes a
linear expression), this reduces the column count — the dominant proving cost the metric tracks —
without raising constraint degree, though it does grow some expression sizes (the selectors appear
in many multiplicities). **Impact: 28 → 24, effectiveness 36/24 = 3/2 = 1.5.**

### 6. Affine normalization / collect-like-terms (`Normalize.lean`) — cascade unlock + de-bloat
Idea: `linearize` only *concatenates* terms, so after affine inlines a flag, a selector sum like
`add + sub + xor + or + and` carries cancelling terms (`x + (-1)·x`) that never collapse. Add a
term-**merge** (`mergeTerms`, via an incremental `addCoeff` with a local eval lemma — sidestepping a
"regroup-sum-by-key" proof) plus zero-dropping, giving `LinExpr.norm`. `Expression.normalize` then
replaces each maximal affine subexpression by its merged form; correct for free via `mapExpr_correct`
(only `normalize_eval`). Field-free.
Worked: yes, with a compounding effect. (a) The selector sum collapses to the constant `1`, so a
constraint `selector * X = 0` folds to `1 * X` → `X`, exposing the previously non-linear timestamp
constraints as affine — the affine pass then eliminates `from_state__timestamp_0` and a second
timestamp variable. (b) Merging also *undoes* the expression bloat from step 5's selector inlining:
the rendered circuit shrinks from ~16 KB to ~7.6 KB (smaller than before step 5). **Impact: 24 → 22,
effectiveness 36/22 = 18/11 ≈ 1.64, with a cleaner (smaller) circuit than any previous step.**

### 7. Concrete correctness capstone (`OpenVM/SnapshotCorrect.lean`)
Not an optimization — a machine-checked instance of `optimizer_maintainsCorrectness` for the exact
snapshot circuit: `addiOptimized.equivalentTo addiInput (openVmBusSemantics babyBear)` and invariant
preservation. Depends only on the three standard Mathlib axioms (`propext`, `Classical.choice`,
`Quot.sound`) — no `sorry`/`native_decide`/custom axiom. Notably it needs **no** primality instance:
every pass is field-agnostic, so correctness holds over any modulus (stronger than the prime-field
setting). **Impact: effectiveness unchanged; adds a concrete verified equivalence for the test case.**

---

### 8. Finite-domain propagation / boolean case analysis (`DomainProp.lean`) — first prime-field pass
Idea: many variables are pinned to a *finite domain* by a product-of-affine-factors constraint
(`x·(x−1)` ⇒ `x ∈ {0,1}`, `c·(255−c)` ⇒ `c ∈ {0,255}`); over an integral domain a product is zero
only if a factor is, and an affine factor has one root — the first place primality is genuinely
needed (`p.Prime` is *decided at runtime* via the compiler-fast `Nat.decidablePrime`; for composite
`p` the pass is the identity, so the optimizer's signature and every existing statement stay
modulus-agnostic). Any constraint whose variables all have finite domains is then decided by
exhaustive enumeration over the domain product (capped at 4096): if every satisfying assignment
gives `x = c`, substitute via the proven `subst_correct`. The enumeration certificate
(`checkForced`) is decidable and is all the proof consumes — the candidate search is proof-free.
This is SAT-style unit propagation on field elements, and it resolves what no affine reasoning can:
from `xor, or, and ∈ {0,1}` and `(1 + xor + 2·or + 3·and)·(xor + 2·or + 3·and) = 0` (the residue of
the one-hot selector constraints after affine elimination of `add`/`sub`), only `(0,0,0)` survives,
so all three remaining opcode flags are 0. Pipeline: inserted after `affineSubstPass` in the cycle;
iterate bumped 16 → 24 (now ~14 substitutions to fixpoint). Worked: yes. The cascade also folds the
bitwise-lookup payloads to `[a_i, a_i, 0, 1]`, drops all five boolean/one-hot constraints and the
four `sub`-carry constraints, leaving 5 algebraic constraints (4-limb add-carry chain + the
`c ∈ {0,255}` immediate-limb constraint). **Impact: 22 → 19, effectiveness 36/19 ≈ 1.89.**
An idea-panel + adversarial-verification workflow over the remaining circuit found no sound,
provable idea with variable impact beyond this pass: the surviving 19 (a/b limbs, prev-data limbs,
prev-timestamps, range-decomposition limbs, c-limbs) are pinned by stateful side effects or by
lookup-table facts whose generic derivation would require enumerating the whole field.

### 9. Affine solving generalized to unit coefficients (`Affine.lean`)
Idea: `trySolve` only pivoted on `±1` coefficients, so a constraint like `2x + 4y + 6 = 0` (no
unit-normalized variable) was unsolvable even over a field where any nonzero coefficient invertible.
Added `trySolveUnit`: pivot on any coefficient `a` passing the decidable re-check `a * a⁻¹ = 1`
(the ring's `Inv`, so soundness never trusts inversion — still field-free: over `ZMod n` exactly
the gcd-1 residues qualify, over a prime field everything nonzero). `solveAffineLin` prefers a
`±1` pivot (substitutes without rescaling, keeping expressions small) and falls back to a unit
pivot. With primality this makes single-constraint linear elimination *complete*: combined with
the iterate-to-fixpoint loop, any variable eliminable by linear reasoning is eliminated.
Worked: yes (proof via `linear_combination` from `eval_split` + the unit certificate).
**Impact: snapshot unchanged (36/19 ≈ 1.89) — every solvable constraint here already had a `±1`
pivot; this is a generality/completeness improvement for other circuits.**

### 10. Satisfied-constant-lookup removal (`TautoBus.lean`)
Idea: a *stateless* interaction whose evaluated message is the same under every assignment
(multiplicity **and** payload all fold to constants — the multiplicity is part of the message
`violatesConstraint` sees, so it must be constant too, a subtlety surfaced by the adversarial
review) and whose constant message the bus table accepts (`violatesConstraint` probed once,
generically, on that message) imposes no obligation and no side effect; dropping it is proven by a
new core, `filterBusStateless_correct` (side effects stay *equal* — stateless interactions never
enter `sideEffects`). This is the first pass that *calls into* the opaque bus semantics, and it is
still fully generic in it. Field-free. Added at the end of the fixpoint cycle.
Worked: yes. On the snapshot it removes the PC-lookup row `[0, 512, 8, 8, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]`, whose
tuple became fully constant back when the constant/affine passes pinned `pc`, `rd_ptr`, `rs1_ptr`,
`rs2`, `rs2_as` (16 → 15 interactions). In general it removes any lookup that substitution turns
into a satisfied table row (e.g. range checks on values that became in-range constants).
**Impact: variables unchanged (19, effectiveness 36/19 ≈ 1.89); one interaction and its 9-tuple
gone from the circuit.**

### 11. Occurrence-aware pivot selection (`Affine.lean`: `bestAffinePivot`)
Idea: `substFromConstraint` substituted the *first* solvable pivot, which inlined the timestamp
into five stateful payloads (a 4-term expression copied per occurrence). Now the pass enumerates
*all* solvable pivots `(x, t)` of all constraints (`solvableFrom`, each candidate carrying the
same per-constraint entailment as before — the heuristic choice adds zero proof burden) and picks
the one minimizing `(occurrences(x) − 1) · (1 + |vars(t)|)`, i.e. the least expression
duplication; a variable occurring only in its defining constraint costs 0. Field-free.
Worked: yes, with a visibly better circuit: `from_state__timestamp_0` stays a plain variable in
the execution-bridge/memory payloads, `c__2_0` is eliminated through the rs2 decomposition (a
`65536`-coefficient unit pivot — entry 9 paying off), the bitwise lookup becomes the literal
`[c__0_0, c__1_0, 0, 0]`, and the carry chain reads directly over `a/b/c` limbs. **Impact:
variables unchanged (19, effectiveness 36/19 ≈ 1.89); rendered circuit 3041 → 2470 bytes (−19%),
now structurally what a hand optimizer would write.**

### 12. Idempotent normalization + deterministic tie-breaking (`Normalize.lean`, `Affine.lean`)
Found by an adversarial completeness panel and reproduced independently: `mergeTerms` used
`foldr` while `addCoeff` appends unseen variables at the tail, so every `normalize` *reversed*
each affine form's term order. The pipeline never reached a structural fixpoint — it was a
period-2 oscillator (variables stable from cycle ~9, term order flipping forever), so the stored
snapshot silently depended on the *parity* of the iterate cap (24 passed, 25 failed, 26 passed —
a trap for cap changes and for the auto-merge vision), and the flipping order leaked into
`bestAffinePivot`'s first-on-tie `argmin`: the structurally identical read/write timestamp
constraints broke their cost-4 ties to *different* pivot kinds, planting `131072⁻¹`-rescaled
constants into a bus-3 payload. Fixes: (a) `mergeTerms` now folds *left* (first-occurrence order,
idempotent; eval-preservation re-proved by an accumulator-generalized induction — same
`addCoeff_eval` core); (b) `solvableFrom` lists all `±1` pivots before general unit pivots, so on
a cost tie the non-rescaling pivot wins deterministically. Verified: one extra full cycle on the
output is now a strict no-op (previously false), the whole optimizer is idempotent, and the
reads/writes halves come out symmetric — all four bus-3 range checks are plain variables again
and the inverse-constant artifacts are gone. **Impact: variables unchanged (19, effectiveness
36/19 ≈ 1.89); output is now a true, cap-independent fixpoint and the circuit is cleaner
(2470 → 2519 bytes: the two memory receive rows now carry the full timestamp decomposition
symmetrically instead of one asymmetric range-check row).**

### 13. Monic scaling of constraint factors (`MonicScale.lean`) — canonicalization
Idea (from the same panel): an algebraic constraint matters only through its zero set, so it may
be rescaled by any *unit* — unlike bus expressions, whose values are observable. A new small core
(`mapConstraintsIff_correct`: rewriting constraints with any pointwise zero-set-preserving map is
`PassCorrect`) plus a product-tree walk that scales every affine factor to monic form, each step
carrying a checked unit certificate (`u * v = 1`; the ring's `Inv` only *proposes* the scale, so
soundness is field-free and holds over any modulus). Runs once after the fixpoint loop, followed
by a fold. Worked: yes. The carry-chain booleanity constraints shed their `256⁻¹` leading
coefficients — the first one now renders literally as `(b₀ + c₀ − a₀) · (b₀ + c₀ − a₀ − 256) = 0`,
the immediate-limb constraint as `(c₀ + 256·c₁ − 1) · (…) = 0` — exactly the form a hand-written
circuit would use. **Impact: variables unchanged (19, effectiveness 36/19 ≈ 1.89); rendered
circuit 2519 → 2402 bytes; whole-optimizer idempotence retained.**

## Summary

Starting from the identity (effectiveness `1`, 36 variables), a pipeline of individually-proven
passes — constant folding, occurrence-cost affine substitution with unit-coefficient pivots,
finite-domain propagation (boolean/one-hot case analysis over prime fields), affine
normalization, trivial-constraint removal, zero-multiplicity bus removal, and tautology-lookup
removal, iterated to a true structural fixpoint, then canonicalized by monic scaling — reduces
the ADD-immediate circuit to **19 variables, effectiveness 36/19 ≈ 1.89**, with 15 bus
interactions and 5 monic algebraic constraints (2402 rendered bytes; e.g. the first carry
constraint is literally `(b₀ + c₀ − a₀) · (b₀ + c₀ − a₀ − 256) = 0`). Every pass is proven
`PassCorrect` with no `sorry`/`admit`/`axiom`/`native_decide` (the public theorems depend only on
`propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`), and the optimizer remains modulus-agnostic: the one
prime-field pass decides `p.Prime` at runtime and is the identity otherwise.

The remaining 19 variables are at the **generic floor**, confirmed both by hand analysis and by
two adversarial idea panels (ideate → merge → refute): 15 appear in stateful bus payloads and are
observable in the side effects; the range-decomposition limbs are required for satisfiability
transfer; and the immediate limbs `c₀ = 1, c₁ = 0` — though true in every satisfying assignment —
are pinned only by lookup-table facts whose generic derivation would require probing the opaque
`violatesConstraint` across the whole field (~2³¹ evaluations inside a decidable certificate that
runs on every build). Going below 19 on this example therefore requires either VM-specific table
axioms in the bus semantics (out of scope: the spec is frozen) or an interactive/offline
certificate mechanism.

### Hints from Georg

#### Memory optimizer

If you look at this pair of bus interactions on the memory bus (1):
```
mult=1, args=[1, 8, b__0_0, b__1_0, b__2_0, b__3_0, from_state__timestamp_0]
mult=2013265920, args=[1, 8, writes_aux__prev_data__0_0, writes_aux__prev_data__1_0, writes_aux__prev_data__2_0, writes_aux__prev_data__3_0, writes_aux__base__prev_timestamp_0]
```

They could cancel out if you set `writes_aux__prev_data__*_0 = b__*_0` and `writes_aux__base__prev_timestamp_0 = from_state__timestamp_0`. This is possible without violating any constraints. That's also a general pattern that often works on the memory bus: Each "access" receives the previous value and sends the new value. If in within one circuit the same address is accessed twice, the first send and second receive can cancel out. This can also be applied iteratively if there are more accesses to the same address.

The received timestamp is usually asserted to be smaller than the current timestamp. That should be the case if you set `writes_aux__base__prev_timestamp_0 = from_state__timestamp_0`.
Your algorithm can be such that it only considers consecutive pairs of interactions *to the same address*. In theory, this could miss opportunities, because they could be out of order, but in practice, the memory bus interactions are already sorted.

#### Figuring out `c`

You should be able to figure out *all* limbs of `c`.

These are the original constraints (written in a more readable way and ordered differently):
```
// The rs2 address space is 0
rs2_as_0 = 0
// The rs2 "address" is 1. Turns out, that's actually the *value* of c!
rs2_0 = 1

// Bus 6 (tuple range checker)
// => c__0_0 and c__1_0 are bytes!
mult=0 + opcode_add_flag_0 + opcode_sub_flag_0 + opcode_xor_flag_0 + opcode_or_flag_0 + opcode_and_flag_0 + 2013265920 * rs2_as_0, args=[c__0_0, c__1_0, 0, 0]

// c__2_0 is either 0 or 255
(1 - rs2_as_0) * (c__2_0 * (255 - c__2_0)) = 0

// c__2_0 == c__3_0
(1 - rs2_as_0) * (c__2_0 - c__3_0) = 0

// Putting everything together, we have:
// c__0_0 + c__1_0 * 2^8 + c__2_0 * 2^16 = 1
// With all the constraints in place, the only solution is c__0_0 = 1, c__1_0 = 0, c__2_0 = 0, c__3_0 = 0!
(1 - rs2_as_0) * (rs2_0 - (c__0_0 + c__1_0 * 256 + c__2_0 * 65536)) = 0
```
### 14. Assessment of hint "Memory optimizer" — blocked by the frozen equivalence (no commit)
The transformation is a *witness choice*, not an entailment: nothing in the circuit forces
`writes_aux__prev_data__* = b__*` — the optimizer must *pin* locally-free variables that occur in
a **stateful** payload. Under the frozen spec this is provably impossible, by a countermodel that
fits in five lines. Take any satisfying `env` with `writes_aux__prev_data = g ≠ b(env)` and
`W(env) = 42` (locally satisfiable: the prev-data limbs are unconstrained). Then
`orig.sideEffects env` contains **four distinct** bus-1 messages with net multiplicities
`⟨(b,R):−1, (b,T):+1, (g,42):−1, (a,T+2):+1⟩`. Any output in which the pair is cancelled (pinned,
substituted, dropped, or merged) has only two bus-1 interactions, and a list of two stateful
entries supports at most two distinct messages with nonzero net multiplicity — so no `env'` can
satisfy `orig.sideEffects env ≈ out.sideEffects env'`, and the `original.implies optimized`
direction of `equivalentTo` fails. (The support-cardinality of the reachable side-effect set is
an invariant of `≈`-equivalence; eliminating observable witness freedom shrinks it.) The same
argument blocks *adding* the constraints `wprev = b` instead of substituting. This is a real gap
between the frozen spec and powdr's de-facto notion: powdr's cancellation is justified
*contextually* (a dangling receive can never balance in any global system, so assignments like
the countermodel's are globally irrelevant — but they are locally satisfying, and the spec
quantifies over all of them). Licensing this optimization requires a spec-level decision, e.g.
comparing side effects only up to balanced global completions, or a bus-discipline-aware
`satisfies`. Deliberately **not** implemented: no `PassCorrect` proof can exist for it.

### 15. Assessment of hint "Figuring out c" — entailment is real, generic derivation is Ω(p) (no commit)
The chain (`c₂ ∈ {0,255}` ⇒ two affine lines for `(c₀,c₁)`; the bus-6 row `[c₀,c₁,0,0]` with
multiplicity 1 obliges `violatesConstraint = false`, i.e. bytes; bytes kill the `c₂ = 255` line
and pin `(c₀,c₁) = (1,0)` on the other) is a genuine entailment of `satisfies` — verified
pointwise against the real semantics, and it is the first derivation that needs the *bus*
half of `satisfies`, which the substitution core supports fine. The wall is decidable
*derivation* inside the optimizer: `violatesConstraint` is an opaque function, so "bytes" can
only be learned by pointwise probing, and soundness needs the whole solution lines covered — an
adversarial semantics agreeing with all probes but accepting one unprobed point admits a
satisfying assignment with a different `c`, so any sound pass must make ~2^32 probes. Measured
probe cost in the elaboration-time interpreter (which is what runs the snapshot `#guard`):
2.7 µs ⇒ ≈ 2 × 98 min per optimizer evaluation. Infeasible; deliberately not implemented.
What would unfreeze it: structured table metadata on `BusSemantics` (a machine-readable range/
tuple spec per bus id, with `violatesConstraint` proven consistent with it) — then the byte facts
become O(1) entailments, the line-enumeration pass is cheap (65 536 points), fully general, and
would take the snapshot to **17 variables (36/17 ≈ 2.12)**; combined with a spec resolution for
entry 14 (**19 → 13** on its own), the two compose to **11 variables (36/11 ≈ 3.27)**. The same
opaque-table wall blocks the related decomposition-limb fusion (`wdec0 + 2^17·wdec1 → w` with a
single 29-bit check, −1 variable): it needs `V([a,17]) = V([b,12]) = false ↔ V([a+2^17·b,29]) =
false`, unknowable without table knowledge.

### 16. Layer 1: proven bus facts + fact-aware domain propagation (`BusFacts.lean`, `OpenVM/Facts.lean`, `FactPass.lean`, `DomainProp.lean`) — 19 → 17
Implements the first layer of `DESIGN-bus-knowledge.md`. `BusFacts p bs` carries proven claims
about a semantics — per-slot value bounds and functional dependences keyed by (busId, constant
pattern), plus table-free buses — so supplying them adds nothing to the audit surface (a wrong
fact would not compile; `openVmFacts`' proofs against the concrete `violates` are ~6 lines
each). `VerifiedPassW` threads facts through the pipeline (`BusFacts.trivial` recovers the
fact-free `optimizer` and its unchanged `optimizerMaintainsCorrectness`; the snapshot now tests
`optimizerWith … openVmFacts`, with `optimizerWith_correct` giving the same two correctness
clauses per instance). Domain propagation gains two new sources of deductions: (a) *fact
domains* — an interaction with constant nonzero multiplicity carrying `x` in a fact-bounded slot
gives `x ∈ [0, bound)`; (b) *probed obligations* — a bus interaction whose variables all have
finite domains is enumerated like a constraint, each point checked directly against the opaque
`violatesConstraint` (small domains make the previously-infeasible probing cheap: 256–65536
calls). Worked: yes. The byte bounds on `c__0_0, c__1_0` (from the bitwise row) let the two-line
constraint enumeration pin `(c₀, c₁) = (1, 0)`; the substitution folds the bitwise row to the
constant `[1, 0, 0, 0]`, which the tautology pass drops, and the carry chain specializes to
literal `b + 1 = a` form: `(b₀ + 1 − a₀) · (b₀ + 1 − a₀ − 256) = 0`. **Impact: 19 → 17
variables, effectiveness 36/17 ≈ 2.12; interactions 15 → 14; the c-limbs, their two-value
constraint, and the immediate lookup are all gone.**
