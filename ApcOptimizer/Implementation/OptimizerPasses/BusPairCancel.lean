/-! # Cancelling matched send/receive pairs on a memory bus

After `busUnifyPass` and the affine/Gauss machinery, a memory access chain leaves the bus with a
*send* `S` (multiplicity `1`) and a later *receive* `R` (multiplicity `-1`) carrying the **same
payload** — the write of one access and the read of the next, unified to the same tuple. These two
messages have opposite multiplicity on the same tuple, so they contribute `0` to every message's
net multiplicity: dropping **both** leaves the bus state (`≈`) unchanged and shrinks the circuit.
It is exactly powdr's memory-interaction cancellation.

Under the spec this is sound because:

* **soundness** (`out.implies cs`): re-adding the pair to reach a witness of `cs` imposes no
  obligation — the send never violates (the `recvByteSlots` contract), and the receive's only
  obligation is that its declared byte slots are bytes, which the pass *justifies from the
  remaining system*: each dropped byte-slot entry is a constant `< 256`, a variable whose proven
  bus-fact bound from a remaining interaction is `≤ 256` (`byteJustified`), or — on prime `p` — a
  variable whose defining constraint pins it to a byte on every point of its selector flags'
  proven finite domains (`deepBoundOk`, the one-hot byte-selection shape). When even that fails,
  the pass *materializes* the obligation as an explicit self-check on a `byteXorSpec` bus
  (`emitOk`), still a net bus win. The pair's net side-effect contribution is `0`;
* **completeness** (`cs.impliesAdmissible out`): removing the pair preserves the VM's `admissible`
  predicate (`admissible_dropPair`), provided the *shield* condition on the before-region `A`
  holds — every active same-address send in `A` is followed by an active same-address receive in
  `A` (`shieldOk`; strictly weaker than "`S` is the earliest active same-address send"). Otherwise
  the removal could expose a fresh consecutive send→receive pair with mismatched payloads; the
  trailing receive shields every earlier send, so none is exposed. This admits access chains led
  by an unmatched boundary store (the common read-modify-write shape). Any emitted check is
  *implied* by the dropped receive's own accepted message, so real traces satisfy it. -/

variable {p : ℕ}

/-! ## Byte justification for the dropped receive's obligation

Under semantics where a memory *receive* of a non-byte word violates (see the OpenVM `violates`),
re-adding a dropped receive is only free when its data limbs are provably bytes under every
assignment satisfying the remaining system. The pass justifies each declared byte slot of the
dropped pair's payload from the *remaining* interactions, so no justification can cite the pair
being dropped. -/

    pass instead passes a per-sweep hash-indexed witness map (`ByteWits`), turning the

/-! ## Affine bound propagation (multi-limb recomposition slots)

A memory data slot is often an affine recomposition of byte limbs — `256·hi + lo`, or
`result₀ + 256·result₁` — which is `< 2¹⁶` whenever each limb is a byte, but is neither a constant,
a single variable, nor a single-variable domain expression, so the justifications above miss it and a

/-! ## Basis justification (range-checked linear forms as building blocks)

`affineJustified` bounds a slot from per-variable bounds alone, which fails on SP1's shift-result
memory slots `16384·r₂ + 4194304·r₃ + h₀ − 65536·h₁`: the slot is 16-bit not because each term is
small but because the circuit *also* range-checks the linear form `r₂ + 256·r₃ − 4·h₁ < 4` (the
shifted-out bits) — the slot is exactly `16384·(that form) + h₀` with `h₀ < 2¹⁴`. `basisJustified`
reduces the target by integer multiples of *range-checked slot forms* drawn from the remaining
interactions (the witness lookup `fwits`), then finishes with the plain per-variable bound: each
step subtracts `μ·F` (with `μ > 0` chosen to cancel one variable's coefficient exactly) and
accounts `μ·(B_F − 1)` against the budget. Soundness needs only that each step's form is a bounded
slot of an accepted interaction — the subtraction itself is exact `LinExpr` algebra, so the value
argument is one nat-level induction (`basisReduceGo_sound`). -/

    byte obligation for `R` is justified by the remaining interactions *including the emitted
    checks* (`hbyte`), with no active same-address message between them (`hmidEval`) and no
    active same-address send before `S` (`hpreEval`). Each emitted check is stateless, implied
    by `R`'s own accepted receive, invariant-free, and adds no variables (`hchecks`) — when
    the remaining system already justifies `R`'s byte slots, `checks` is simply `[]`. Dropping
    the pair and appending the checks is `PassCorrect`. -/

/-! ### Hash-indexed receive lookup

`findCancelGo` probed every send against the whole remaining list, structurally comparing
payloads — ~90% of the pass's runtime, repeated once per dropped pair. The candidate receives
(constant `-1` multiplicity, on the bus) are instead indexed **once per invocation** by a
structural payload hash; a send probe is then a hash lookup plus an exact payload comparison on
the (rare) hash hits. Hash inequality proves payload inequality, and hits are re-verified
structurally, so exactly the same first matching receive is found — the pass's output is
unchanged, and its correctness never depended on the search (the accepted candidate is
re-verified by `checkCancel` and the decided split equation). -/

/-- Positions (ascending) of the candidate receives (the `getPrevious`, multiplicity
    `-shape.setNewMult`) on **every** memory-shaped bus, keyed by the bus id mixed with the payload
    hash — one build serves the whole sweep, instead of one O(#interactions) rebuild per bus. The
    receive multiplicity is read from each bus's own declared shape (`-shape.setNewMult`), so a bus
    that sets-new with `-1` (SP1's memory, whose reads carry `+1`) is indexed correctly, not just
    the `-1` convention of OpenVM memory / every VM's execution bridge. In the cycle
    (`aggressive = false`) the payload part of the key is the exact payload hash — tiny buckets,
    cheap syntactic probes. In the coda (`aggressive = true`) it is the *address-slot* hash
    (`addrHash`, computed against the bus's own declared shape), a coarsening under which
    entailed-equal value slots still land in the probed bucket while addresses must agree
    syntactically to be found at all. Purely heuristic: probes re-verify the bus id and payload,
    so a hash collision can only cost time, never a wrong drop. -/

one invocation (`cancelLoop` transports the thunks) — as the plain `domCs` list and this

/-! ### Constraint-entailed payload matching

A send and its matching receive can carry *syntactically different* value slots that the
algebraic constraints force equal — e.g. `busUnify` adds the slot equality
`read_data − ((1−flag)·srd0 + flag·srd1) = 0` but Gauss cannot apply it within the degree
bound, so the payloads never become syntactically identical. The pair still cancels: the
net-zero side-effect argument needs only *evaluated* payload equality, which the constraints
force — and constraint satisfaction is available in **both** refinement directions because a
drop leaves `algebraicConstraints` untouched. `EqConstraintMap` indexes the normalized
constraints by structural hash, so a slot difference is decided by one `normalize` and a hash
probe (mirroring `TwoRootMap`'s once-per-invocation, proof-carrying design). -/

/-! ### Stable live projection (tombstoned interaction array)

`cancelLoop` used to rebuild `cs.busInteractions.toArray` and the consolidated receive index
after *every* accepted drop — O(#interactions) with a structural-hash traversal of every surviving
receive payload, repeated once per pair on a chain. Instead the array and index are built once per
pass invocation and a drop merely *tombstones* the two cancelled positions in a liveness array
(`alive`), leaving every later position in place (so the index stays valid). The logical
`busInteractions` at any point is the **live projection** `liveSeg arr alive 0 arr.size ++ checks`:
the live entries in stable order, followed by the byte checks emitted so far. It is materialized
once, at the end; intermediate logical systems live only inside the (erased) `PassCorrect` proof.

`liveSeg arr alive lo n` is the live entries of `arr` at the `n` positions `[lo, lo+n)`, skipping
tombstoned ones (structural recursion on the count `n`, so the equation lemmas unfold cleanly). -/

When the search accepts a pair `(iP, jP)` (both live, `iP < jP < size`), the live projection
factors as `A ++ S :: B ++ R :: C'` (`liveSeg_split`) — feeding `checkCancel_sound` exactly as the
old `split_of_extracts` did. Tombstoning the two positions changes the projection to `A ++ B ++ C'`
(`liveSeg_drop`), so the post-drop logical `busInteractions` (`… ++ checks`) matches the
`A ++ B ++ C ++ checks` shape `checkCancel_sound` produces. Both are pure `liveSeg` algebra. -/

/-! ### Tail-recursive runtime builder

`liveSeg` is the proof-level *specification*, but as a runtime routine it is unsuitable on large
blocks: it is not tail-recursive (`(if … [a] else []) ++ liveSeg …`), so materializing the whole
projection or a large before-region recurses `n` deep, and it reads every element through a checked
`Option` lookup (`arr[k]?`/`alive[k]?`). `liveArr` is the tail-recursive array-builder used at every
runtime site (the per-candidate `A`/`B` regions and the one final materialization): it accumulates
in reverse and reverses once, and — given the maintained size invariant `alive.size = arr.size` and
`lo + n ≤ arr.size` — indexes with `arr[lo]`/`alive[lo]` (no `Option`). `liveArr_eq` proves it equal
to `liveSeg`, so the correctness proofs continue to reason about `liveSeg` exclusively. -/
