/-! # Native correctness for the dense syntactic-duplicate removal pass (Task 3)

This module proves `DensePassCorrect` for the dense dedup transform (`Dense/Dedup.lean`)
**natively** over dense environments `VarId → ZMod p`, with no commutation to the spec pass and no
`decode` in the discharged obligations. The spec pass's own `PassCorrect` proof
(`OptimizerPasses/Dedup.lean`, `ConstraintSystem.dedup_correct`) is only the roadmap: its argument
structure (`PassCorrect.ofEnvEq` fed by satisfaction-iff, side-effect equality, and
admissibility-iff) is mirrored here over the native dense semantics of `Dense/Bridge.lean`.

Dedup drops structurally-duplicate algebraic constraints (`List.dedup`) and structurally-duplicate
*stateless* bus interactions (keep-first). Both operations only shrink the constraint/interaction
sets while leaving the satisfying set, the (stateful-only) side effects and `admissible` unchanged —
so `env' = env` is the completeness witness and no derivations are produced.

The pass runs the fully hash-bucketed `dedupN` (constraints via `denseDedupConstraintsFast`,
interactions via `denseDedupStatelessFast`), which equals the reference keep-first `dedup`
(`dedupN_eq`); correctness therefore transports along `dedupN_eq` to the reference version's native
proof. The membership-preserving helpers `denseDedupStateless_covers`/`_statefulFilter` live in
`Dense/Dedup.lean` (kept `Bridge`-free); the evaluated-message helper `denseDedupStateless_evalFilter`
is stated over `denseBIEval` and so lives here alongside the native proof. -/
