/-! # Dense generalized single-value byte-check packing (Task 3, chunk BP-I1 — impl)

Dense, `VarId`-native transliteration of the reference `ByteCheckPack` pass's *runtime* content:
`complExpr` (:37), `isByteCompl` (:42), `svCheck?` (:63), `findSecond` (:231), `findGo` (:268), and
the pass `byteCheckPackPass` (:315), which the `"bytePack"`/`"bytePackLate"` labels
(`Implementation/Optimizer.lean`) each run through an outer `iterateToFixpoint`. This is
**impl-only** (chunk BP-I1 of the port): no `_sound` lemma is ported (`isByteCompl_sound`,
`svCheck?_sound`, `findSecond_sound`, and `findGo`'s inline `mergeStateless2_correct` obligation are
all proof, left for the prover), and no theorem is stated here; nothing is wired into the
`denseImpl` selector.

## Reuse map

* `mkBytePair` → `denseMkBytePair` (`BusPairCancelCheck.lean`, placed next to `denseMkByteCheck` per
  its module header's flag for this very port).
* `Expression.normalize` → `DenseExpr.normalize` (`Normalize.lean:54`).
* `Expression.constValue?` → `DenseExpr.constValue?` (`DropPasses.lean:64`).
* `DecidableEq (Expression p)`/`DecidableEq (BusInteraction (Expression p))` (from
  `deriving instance` in `FactPass.lean`) → `DecidableEq (DenseExpr p)` (derived directly on the
  inductive, `Encoding.lean:33`) and the generic derived `DecidableEq (BusInteraction α)` instance
  applied at `α := DenseExpr p`. `facts.byteXorSpec`/`ByteXorSpec.decode`/`encode` are
  representation-independent (`{α : Type} → …`) and are consulted unqualified, exactly as the spec
  does.

## `denseFindGo`'s positional split (no re-`decide`)

The spec `findGo` returns an `Option (PassResult cs bs)`: at the chosen candidate it checks (via a
`dite`) that `cs.busInteractions = revPre.reverse ++ a :: mid ++ b :: post` — an O(n) equation that,
given how `revPre`/`mid`/`post` were threaded by the scan itself, always holds at runtime; the
`dite` exists only so the *proof* obligation (`mergeStateless2_correct`'s hypotheses) has that
equation available, not because the scan could ever produce a wrong split. `denseFindGo` below drops
the `cs`/`hp1` parameters (unused by the scan's own selection decisions — only by the spec's
`PassResult` construction) and the re-`decide`, returning the positionally-split pack data directly:
`(busId, spec, pre, eA, mid, eB, post)` with `pre = revPre.reverse`. The **selection** — first `a`
with `denseSvCheck? = some eA`; first `b` strictly after `a` on the same bus with
`denseSvCheck? = some eB` (`denseFindSecond`); `a`'s `byteXorSpec` bus-fact lookup and its `bound =
256` gate — is mirrored in the exact same order as the spec, so the pair chosen is identical to what
the spec would choose against the same input list; only the re-verification of the (trivially true)
split equation is dropped. `busId` (`= a.busId`, needed by `denseMkBytePair` at the call site but not
part of the spec's own six informally-named return components `spec, pre, eA, mid, eB, post`) is
carried explicitly as the tuple's first component — a data-completeness addition, not a selection or
control-flow change; **flagged for the prover**, who reconstructs the split equation
`d.busInteractions = pre ++ a :: mid ++ b :: post` as a loop invariant of the scan rather than
re-deciding it. -/
