/-! # Dropping matched send/receive pairs preserves `admissibleMemoryBus`

The `MemoryBus`-level machinery behind the pair-cancellation pass (`OptimizerPasses/BusPairCancel`).
When a memory access chain leaves a *send* `S` (multiplicity `1`) and a later *receive* `R`
(multiplicity `-1`) carrying the same payload — the write of one access and the read of the next —
the two contribute `0` to every message's net multiplicity, so both can be dropped. The completeness
half needs the VM's `admissible` predicate to survive that drop; these lemmas discharge that at the
concrete-discipline level (`admissibleMemoryBus`).

Kept out of the audit surface (`MemoryBus.lean`): these are consequences of the discipline, not part
of it. The reverse bridge that lets a *generic* pass rebuild the abstract `bs.admissible` from these
is the `admissible_dropPair` field of `BusFacts`. -/
