/-! # Proven auxiliary knowledge about a bus semantics

`BusSemantics` exposes its lookup tables only through the opaque `violatesConstraint`, so a
generic optimizer cannot learn facts like "this bus range-checks its first payload entry"
without probing the whole field. `BusFacts` is the sound channel for that knowledge: a
structure *dependent on the semantics* in which every claim carries a proof against it — the
kernel checks the facts, so supplying them adds **nothing** to the audit surface, and a pass
consuming them stays correct for arbitrary semantics (with `BusFacts.trivial` it degrades to
the fact-free behavior).

A *pattern* is a payload template: `some c` entries must equal the evaluated message's entry,
`none` entries are free. Passes build patterns from the constant entries of a concrete
interaction, so facts can be conditional on e.g. an op-selector slot (see `Leanr/Implementation/OpenVmFacts.lean`).

  /-- Reverse bridge for pair cancellation (the completeness half). Dropping a matched, isolated
      send→receive pair from a declared bus preserves `admissible`: given a send `S` and a later
      receive `R` on `busId` with equal addresses, no active same-address message between them
      (`B`), and no active same-address send before `S` (`A`), removing both from the active-stateful
      message list keeps it admissible. Gated on `memShape busId = some shape`, so `trivial` (no
      shapes) discharges it vacuously; for a VM whose `admissible` is the per-bus `admissibleMemoryBus`
      conjunction it follows from `admissibleMemoryBus_dropPair`. Takes `1 ≠ 0` (the pass supplies

  /-- Byte-check pairing on a bitwise-style *stateless* bus. If `bytePairBus busId = true` then the
      bus is stateless and, for every pair of operand values and any multiplicity, the pair-check

      `[y, y, 0, 1]` are. So two single-value byte checks pack losslessly into one pair check, with
      the *same* satisfying set (each side imposes "both operands are bytes") — a bus-interaction
      win. `trivial` sets it `false` (recovering fact-free behavior); the OpenVM instance proves it
